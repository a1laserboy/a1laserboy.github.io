	<h1>It's your birthday Ola, I hope you have the most amazing time in the days you are off!</h1>

	<p>I apologise for the shittyness of this little site, but I learned how to do it by myself. I had to get a lot of help to post it online. I want to thank Sam, he is the coding master and i'm sure he will read this to see how his student is doing ;)</p>
